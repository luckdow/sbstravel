Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added and proper indentation maintained. I've added the following closing brackets/tags in the correct positions:

```javascript
                            <span>FATURA</span>
                          </button>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                    ))
                  )}
                  </div>
                )}
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing tags for several nested div elements
2. Missing closing parentheses for map function
3. Missing closing brackets for conditional rendering blocks
4. Incomplete button elements

The structure is now properly nested and all brackets are matched. The component should now render correctly without any syntax errors.

Note: Some sections of the code appeared to have duplicate content (like multiple definitions of the same modals/sections). I've kept the most complete versions and removed duplicates while maintaining the functionality.
