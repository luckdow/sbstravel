Here's the fixed version with added closing brackets. I've added the missing closing brackets at the end of the file:

```javascript
// ... (rest of the code remains the same until the last few lines)

  <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

The issue was that there were missing closing brackets for the component's return statement and the function declaration. I've added both the closing parenthesis `)` for the return statement and the closing curly brace `}` for the function declaration.
